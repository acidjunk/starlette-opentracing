`OpenTracing`_ support for Starlette and FastApi. Inspired by: `Flask-OpenTracing`_
OpenTracing implementations exist for major distributed tracing systems and can be bound or swapped with a one-line
configuration change. This package uses the `OpenTracing API for Python`_ to implement it's functionality.

WORK IN PROGRESS. Not ready for production!

The package will implement: Starlette middleware that can be used to add Opentracing support to all incoming requests.

It will, when ready, also contain 2 decorators that can be used to decorate routes: one to setup tracing without
the middleware and one to add extra tags/spans for an endpoint.
